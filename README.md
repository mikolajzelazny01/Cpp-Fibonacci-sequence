# Cpp-Fibonacci-sequence
<p align="justify">This is a simple Fibonacci sequence code I've done. Main() is aimed only to show what the written function does.
Fibonacci function calculates, displays and return value of n element of fibonacci sequence. <br>
To prevent function from displaying values u can simply enter whatever string you want as an optional argument f.ex. "no"  <br>
n - index of an element<br>
In this code, the index of the first element(0) is 0.
